Temperature Converter in C:

PROJECT OVERVIEW:

The Temperature Converter project is a command-line utility built using the C programming language, designed to perform temperature conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. 
This tool is especially useful for students, developers, or anyone needing quick and accurate temperature conversions without using a calculator or an online tool. 
The project is structured with a user-friendly interface and modular code, making it easy to use and maintain.

PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE:

The primary purpose of this project is to create an educational tool that demonstrates fundamental programming concepts in C while serving a practical purpose.
It offers a straightforward, user-friendly interface and is constructed with modularity in mind, making it an excellent reference for beginners learning C.
Additionally, the project aims to:
Enhance Understanding: Help learners grasp basic control structures, functions, and arithmetic operations in C.
Provide a Utility: Offer a functional temperature conversion tool that can be used in everyday scenarios.
Promote Code Modularity: Showcase how to organize code effectively by breaking down the logic into smaller, manageable function.


SCOPE: 

The scope of this project includes:

A menu-driven interface that allows users to select from multiple conversion options.
Accurate temperature conversion using established scientific formulas.
The ability to handle both integer and floating-point temperature values.
An easy-to-understand codebase that can be extended or modified for more advanced functionalities.

HOW IT WORKS :
1. Program Initialization
When the program starts, it initializes the necessary variables and displays a menu with conversion options to the user.
2. Menu Interaction
The user is prompted to choose the desired conversion type by entering a number corresponding to the options listed in the menu.
The program then requests the user to input the temperature value that they wish to convert.
3. Conversion Logic
The core of the program is the conversion logic, where the entered temperature is processed based on the selected conversion type.
Each conversion type is handled by a separate function, ensuring that the code is clean, organized, and easy to debug or extend.
4. Displaying Results:
After performing the conversion, the program outputs the converted temperature, rounded to two decimal places, for better readability and precision.
The user is then asked whether they wish to perform another conversion or exit the program.
5. Looping Mechanism
If the user opts to continue, the program loops back to the menu, allowing for multiple conversions within the same session.
If the user chooses to exit, the program terminates gracefully.
